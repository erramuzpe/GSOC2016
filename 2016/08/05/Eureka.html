<p>This week I finally made the new Engine work! As we are approaching the end of GSoC 2016, I am more and more concentrated in the project and, even if I feel that NeuroVault is a mid-sized project that has many parts that still I don&#8217;t understand, the whole thing starts to make sense for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me resume what I was doing last week, because it was really a great bunch of things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I made through and migrated the whole Engine, making it work. Additions, super-fast indexes, super-fast similarity queries, changes and deletions of new maps are working as they should, and this makes me very happy :_) .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the best thing of this achievement is not that I made it (LOL), but <strong>HOW</strong> I made it. So, the thing was that I was working on migration, I made the insertions and building of the Engine, everything working fine&#8230;&#8203; <strong>but</strong>, I arrived to the moment of implementing image changes and deletions and I realized that NearPy has no implemented method for such thing. It has a deletion of bucket method, but I needed the one for a single key and vector. <span class="image"><img src="https://kallinablog.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/shocked-emoji.png?w=462" alt="fear" width="50" height="50"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, don&#8217;t panic, let&#8217;s go to Project&#8217;s repo&#8230;&#8203; and found <a href="https://github.com/pixelogik/NearPy/issues/42">this issue</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/following/2015/12/04/thinky.w560.h375.jpg" alt="thinker" width="80" height="100"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seems like many people was asking for this specific feature before (long time before). Do I have any other option? I really <strong>need</strong> this method to keep working.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯  &#8594; Me like &#8230;&#8203;   <em>Why not?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, let&#8217;s fork it and start working on it. In a hour and a half, the problem was solved for main memory implementation (not Redis Storage, dissapointingly). Not a big deal after all, just some iterations over all hashes and buckets looking for the specific key and deleting if found. I got requested to write some tests, and did so, with the big help of a developer. Problem solved! (partially)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Problem: The <a href="https://github.com/pixelogik/NearPy/pull/57">PR</a> is mergeable, but from NearPy they are asking for the Redis Storage version to be also implemented before merging. I said I could work on it, but after GSoC is finished, as I have plenty of work ahead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second Problem: It will be difficult to have the Redis Storage implemented for GSoC.
The reason is that due to constraints in how the Engine is built, could be that Redis storage it is not the best option for our project (I would need to study this more deeply with the mentor). Redis Storage allows to save the hashes in Redis, what forces to rebuild the engine everytime we need to save/delete a key. I would like to know if it is possible to perform these actions directly into Redis (without building the Engine), that would be perfect. Anyway, I will wait until the deletion method is implemented and then I will be able to test performance differences between Redis implementation and the actual one (saving/loading the Engine in memory).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_what_else_did_you_get_done">What else did you get done?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I factored all the main migration actions to be consistent (still some work to do here). I built separate commands for build_engine() and dimensionality_reduction() in case it is needed to rebuild it from time to time. I also continued the documentation work, that will be a big thing. I compared the results for [16,16,16], [8,8,8] and [4,4,4] map_reduced_representation dimensions visually. There is no change between then in the results, but there is a big change in performance. I will explain this deeply in the documentation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_what_do_you_plan_on_doing_next_week">What do you plan on doing next week?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finish and clean the migration PR. Write tests. Clean previous implementation&#8217;s code not being used anymore. Control access to shared tasks (writing, deletion of keys) with Celery. Write more documentation. If I have time, make experiments with different Engine parameters (distances, PCA, bit number, hash table number&#8230;&#8203;), as I can evaluate visually the results.</p>
